Sentiment Analysis API
Project Background
The Sentiment Analysis API is a simple web application built using FastAPI that uses machine learning algorithms (like Naive Bayes) to analyze text data and determine its sentiment â€” positive, negative, or neutral. This API can be used for analyzing customer feedback, reviews, or any text input to assess its sentiment, providing valuable insights for businesses.
